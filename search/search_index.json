These basic components are needed in order to access, store, recieve, and transfer digital data to and from the internet. What Hardware Infrastucture is Needed Modem: Allows a computer or router to connect to the internet. Since most internet connections are through telephone lines, modems are used to convert digital data into analogue signals (used for telephone lines). Modern modems have built-in routers. Router: Sends and recieves data on the internet. Reads digital data and decides where to send it. Also stores IP addresses (internet protocol addresses) that tell the location you are accessing the internet at. Allows multiple devices to connect to the same internet connection at once. Network Interface Card (NIC): Connects individual devices to a network. It is usually built into the device. Can be wireless or wired. Wireless is through Wi-fi signals, while wired connections are through network cables. Wired connections send data faster and is more secure than wireless.

They are a security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to confidental data. When many attempts fail(when a username/password does not match the orginal information entered) the user will not be granted access. Many applications block users from trying to login after multiple failed attempts. User access is a way for one to have a personalized account on a application/website to do/enjoy what the functions and activities the website/application provides. What forms of user access exist? The basic and most used form of loggining is simpily entering in a email followed up with a password. Some sites/applications will have you enter in a username as well, once that is all set; most applications/websites will have you verify the email you used. Websites/applications have alternative ways to login, such as a numeraic pin. A pin, you simpily enter numeraic digits, usually only about four or five characters. What limitations come with user access? Limitations involve the information you use to create/access your account through the site/application. This is by the means of the username/password and email used and so on. The information you used is to be secured by the website/applicaitons but includes your own doing as well, say you input a username/password that is simple with little characters; this causes some risk to your accounts. It makes it easy for hackers to gain access, hense why websites/applications usually ask for a strong and concise username/password, this also applies to your email. I'd say even more so because your email is the main source for all of your accounts you have made for different websites/applications; If you're username/password for your email is simple with little characters it could make it easier for hackers to gain access to your email/access to all accounts associated to thus email. What new formats might there be? Theres more to user access than just inserting a username and password. Over the years of developing user access, developers have come up with new ways of accessing accounts on different websites/applications. The use of the finger print came into being, a more personal function to indentifiying the users identity by just pressing your finger on a device or extention. Other examples include, MagicLinks( A authorized link to your email/pretty basic), Key Fobs(small plastic discs that contain internal technology) and also, ID Cards or physical tokens. I hope this infomration was helpful in some form of way and drew in interest, if you would like to learn more on user access there some links at the bottom of the page you can search through.

Have you ever had to take your computer to a store to get it fixed because it had a virus or it crashed? Maybe you clicked on a link to a website that was corrupt, or had a virus coded in it. Sometimes when this happens you do not even now that it has happened. When you get a virus on your device it can go from just one website link to spread to the whole device. Which might lead to you losing the whole device or a lot of personal information. A computer virus is a piece of programmed code that has been created to copy itself into other codes or computer files. Virus can go and destroy data and programmed code. These viruses are grouped under one name called malware. Malware is simply any software that is intentionally designed to cause damage. Types of malware are file infecting, macro virus, browser hijacker, web scripting, and many more. Ways to deal with viruses is to get virus protection on your device. Usually when you buy a computer it will come with some type of virus protection, or you will get offered one. Some virus protectors out there are Total AV, PcProtect, McAfee, AGV, and many more. The reason why you should have virus protection is to stop you from getting viruses on your computer. Antivirus software works by scanning incoming code and files that come through your network. Other common security threats out there are spyware, adware and trojan horse. Spyware and adware is software that is used to track your web browsing habits and start giving you ad pop ups about those things. Trojan horse refers to hackers tricking people into letting them into their computers server. Some other internet threats are phishing, DDOS, and computer worms. In conclusion, you should really have some type of antivirus software on your computer. Even if you think you are being careful and safe. The truth is in this day and age hackers are getting smarter and sneeker. So make sure you do not click on emails that look suspicious to you if you have no idea where it came from. Also if you ever get random text messages from unknown numbers with content that you have no idea about, it is safe to assume it is a virus. resources Antivirus software How does Antivirus Different types of virus Top 10 Common Security Threats","title":"security"},{"location":"security/#internet-issue-security-threats-what-are-they-how-to-deal-with-them","text":"Written by Karen Mitchell image design by your \u00a9 Karen Mitchell There are lots of security issues you can encounter on the internet.
