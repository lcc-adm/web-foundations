These basic components are needed in order to access, store, recieve, and transfer digital data to and from the internet. What Hardware Infrastucture is Needed Modem: Allows a computer or router to connect to the internet. Since most internet connections are through telephone lines, modems are used to convert digital data into analogue signals (used for telephone lines). Modern modems have built-in routers. Router: Sends and recieves data on the internet. Reads digital data and decides where to send it. Also stores IP addresses (internet protocol addresses) that tell the location you are accessing the internet at. Allows multiple devices to connect to the same internet connection at once. Network Interface Card (NIC): Connects individual devices to a network. It is usually built into the device. Can be wireless or wired. Wireless is through Wi-fi signals, while wired connections are through network cables. Wired connections send data faster and is more secure than wireless.

Have you ever had to take your computer to a store to get it fixed because it had a virus or it crashed? Maybe you clicked on a link to a website that was corrupt, or had a virus in it. Sometimes when this happens you do not even now that it has happened. When you get a virus on your device it can go from just one website link and spread to the whole device. Which might lead to you losing the whole device or a lot of personal information. A computer virus is a piece of programmed code that has been created to copy itself into other codes or computer files. These viruses could be created by someone that wants to prank people, steal files, or anything else. In the end it really ends up hurting the people that get the virus because it can go and destroy data and programmed code. These viruses are grouped under one name which is called malware. Malware is simply any software that is intentionally designed to cause damage. Types of malware are file infecting, macro virus, browser hijacker, web scripting, and many more. Ways to deal with viruses is to get virus protection on your device. Usually when you buy a computer it will come with some type of virus protection, or you will get offered one. Some virus protectors out there are Total AV, PcProtect, McAfee, AGV, and many more. The reason why you should have virus protection is to stop you from getting viruses on your computer. Antivirus software works by scanning incoming code and files that come through your network. In conclusion, you should really have some type of antivirus software on your computer. Even if you think you are being careful and safe. The truth is in this day and age hackers are getting smarter and sneakier. So make sure you do not click on emails that look suspicious to you if you have no idea where it came from. Also if you ever get random text messages from unknown numbers say \u201cclick here to get a free iphone 12\u201d or anything like that, it is safe to assume it is a virus or something you should not be clicking on. resources Antivirus software How does Antivirus Different types of virus","title":"security"},{"location":"security/#internet-issue-security-threats-what-are-they-how-to-deal-with-them","text":"Written by Karen Mitchell image design by your \u00a9 Karen Mitchell There are lots of security issues you can encounter on the internet.
