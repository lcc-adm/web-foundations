Whether its server side communications, running cloud services or formatting and presenting a website to the user in a digestible manner and that precisely is what I will be going over with this article. For the purpose of being cursory I will only be discussing the main languages used today according to the research I have done. HTML HTML also known as Hyper Text Markup Language is the main markup language used for the displaying of documents in a web browser. HTML is very rarely seen on its own; it\u2019s more of a framework that most websites will build off of mainly using html\u2019s ability to embed scripts using javascript to change the way a website will function upon launch and css as a method of formatting and laying out the content. C Another forerunner of development in the IOT is C not only for its low amount of resources taken up which allows it to be used widely whether its on a wide array of hardware or being the framework for many other languages but also the fact that it is procedural instead of object oriented which goes great with the fact that C is compiled. Java Java is the most popular language used for web development; and also goes on to many other uses which include game development, software engineering and development on the android platform. Java is so widely used to a point where some studies have shown that over 15 billion devices have used an instance of java. Python Python is a programming language with a highly readable syntax being able to be interpreted and used in a way that more complex languages can not while still not compromising on what it is able to deliver which make it suitable for data analysis in a lot of cases. Javascript Java and Javascript tend to get confusing to tell the difference between quite a bit so let me explain; Java needs to be compiled and relies on the hardware whereas javascript is just text along with being more website oriented and because of that javascript does not have the functionality of making applets instead mainly being embedded in html web pages requiring different plugins or additional libraries to make it work References What programming languages rule the internet of things top six coding languages for IOT projects common web design languages what they do and why you need them java help page","title":"coding languates"},{"location":"coding/#coding-languages","text":"","title":"Coding Languages"},{"location":"coding/#by-chaz-dyer","text":"image design \u00a9 Chaz Dyer The internet of things IOT for short runs on an insane amount of languages that are used for many various purposes.

Since most internet connections are through telephone lines, modems are used to convert digital data into analogue signals (used for telephone lines). Modern modems have built-in routers. Router: Sends and recieves data on the internet. Reads digital data and decides where to send it. Also stores IP addresses (internet protocol addresses) that tell the location you are accessing the internet at. Allows multiple devices to connect to the same internet connection at once. Network Interface Card (NIC): Connects individual devices to a network. It is usually built into the device. Can be wireless or wired. Wireless is through Wi-fi signals, while wired connections are through network cables. Wired connections send data faster and is more secure than wireless.

In-browser coding tools. Every modern computer has these powerful tools. Some of these powerful tools inspect HTML, javascript, and CSS. These tools allow you to do a variety of things to web developers' code, like debugging and testing it. These tools make it so you can see how other people produce their websites using code. Each browser is a little different in how it works but overall it's pretty interesting and once you understand what they do they can be a huge help. How they work To inspect any page's code by using browser developer tools simply right click and click inspect or inspect element. Once you click inspect it should bring up a small tab that shows you all the elements used to create and put together the website you are on. Along with the element panel, there is a style panel. This contains the CSS It also allows you to see the console, sources, network, performance, memory, application, and security. You can also pinpoint a certain element you may want to inspect by highlighting it first then right-click and click inspect. You can also put your code on the page. Of course, none of this will change the view of the page for others but it will temporarily change your view until you refresh the page. What they are used for In browser coding tools are used for a lot of things. They can be used to see a page's HTML or CSS. They can be used for help or inspiration on creating your HTML or CSS. It can be used to temporarily see how a page would look if you changed a line of code or switched up the CSS. They make no direct creations of a webpage nor do they edit them, but they are used for web applications and user interfaces. Differences by browser Each browser coding tool changes depending on which browser you decide on using. For example, Google comes with Chrome DevTools. In other browsers you may have to download dev tools on your own or choose between several different dev tools to download. An example of this would be Mozilla Firefox. With Firefox you get to choose between either getting Firebug or Firefox Developer Edition. For the most part, the coding tools are all pretty similar and most of them get the job done. It's never a terrible thing though to go and check out different browser coding tools to test and compare and see which one you like better. resources this is where you list your sources and links: essential tools for front-end development what are browser development tools front-end development tools using the browser developer tools edge F12 vs firefox and chrome javascript debugging tools","title":"in-browser coding tools"},{"location":"in-browser/#in-browser-coding-tools","text":"by Lowell Halliwill image design by \u00a9 Lowell Halliwill","title":"in-browser coding tools"},{"location":"in-browser/#what-are-they","text":"In-browser coding tools.

They are a security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to confidental data. When many attempts fail(when a username/password does not match the orginal information entered) the user will not be granted access. Many applications block users from trying to login after multiple failed attempts. User access is a way for one to have a personalized account on a application/website to do/enjoy what the functions and activities the website/application provides. What forms of user access exist? The basic and most used form of loggining is simpily entering in a email followed up with a password. Some sites/applications will have you enter in a username as well, once that is all set; most applications/websites will have you verify the email you used. Websites/applications have alternative ways to login, such as a numeraic pin. A pin, you simpily enter numeraic digits, usually only about four or five characters. What limitations come with user access? Limitations involve the information you use to create/access your account through the site/application. This is by the means of the username/password and email used and so on. The information you used is to be secured by the website/applicaitons but includes your own doing as well, say you input a username/password that is simple with little characters; this causes some risk to your accounts. It makes it easy for hackers to gain access, hense why websites/applications usually ask for a strong and concise username/password, this also applies to your email. I'd say even more so because your email is the main source for all of your accounts you have made for different websites/applications; If you're username/password for your email is simple with little characters it could make it easier for hackers to gain access to your email/access to all accounts associated to thus email. What new formats might there be? Theres more to user access than just inserting a username and password. Over the years of developing user access, developers have come up with new ways of accessing accounts on different websites/applications. The use of the finger print came into being, a more personal function to indentifiying the users identity by just pressing your finger on a device or extention. Other examples include, MagicLinks( A authorized link to your email/pretty basic), Key Fobs(small plastic discs that contain internal technology) and also, ID Cards or physical tokens.

Have you ever had to take your computer to a store to get it fixed because it had a virus or it crashed? Maybe you clicked on a link to a website that was corrupt, or had a virus coded in it. Sometimes when this happens you do not even now that it has happened. When you get a virus on your device it can go from just one website link to spread to the whole device. Which might lead to you losing the whole device or a lot of personal information. A computer virus is a piece of programmed code that has been created to copy itself into other codes or computer files. Virus can go and destroy data and programmed code. These viruses are grouped under one name called malware. Malware is simply any software that is intentionally designed to cause damage. Types of malware are file infecting, macro virus, browser hijacker, web scripting, and many more. Ways to deal with viruses is to get virus protection on your device. Usually when you buy a computer it will come with some type of virus protection, or you will get offered one. Some virus protectors out there are Total AV, PcProtect, McAfee, AGV, and many more. The reason why you should have virus protection is to stop you from getting viruses on your computer. Antivirus software works by scanning incoming code and files that come through your network. Other common security threats out there are spyware, adware and trojan horse. Spyware and adware is software that is used to track your web browsing habits and start giving you ad pop ups about those things. Trojan horse refers to hackers tricking people into letting them into their computers server. Some other internet threats are phishing, DDOS, and computer worms. In conclusion, you should really have some type of antivirus software on your computer. Even if you think you are being careful and safe. The truth is in this day and age hackers are getting smarter and sneeker. So make sure you do not click on emails that look suspicious to you if you have no idea where it came from.

Sometimes when this happens you do not even now that it has happened. When you get a virus on your device it can go from just one website link to spread to the whole device. Which might lead to you losing the whole device or a lot of personal information. A computer virus is a piece of programmed code that has been created to copy itself into other codes or computer files. Virus can go and destroy data and programmed code. These viruses are grouped under one name called malware. Malware is simply any software that is intentionally designed to cause damage. Types of malware are file infecting, macro virus, browser hijacker, web scripting, and many more. Ways to deal with viruses is to get virus protection on your device. Usually when you buy a computer it will come with some type of virus protection, or you will get offered one. Some virus protectors out there are Total AV, PcProtect, McAfee, AGV, and many more. The reason why you should have virus protection is to stop you from getting viruses on your computer. Antivirus software works by scanning incoming code and files that come through your network. Other common security threats out there are spyware, adware and trojan horse. Spyware and adware is software that is used to track your web browsing habits and start giving you ad pop ups about those things. Trojan horse refers to hackers tricking people into letting them into their computers server. Some other internet threats are phishing, DDOS, and computer worms. In conclusion, you should really have some type of antivirus software on your computer. Even if you think you are being careful and safe. The truth is in this day and age hackers are getting smarter and sneeker. So make sure you do not click on emails that look suspicious to you if you have no idea where it came from. Also if you ever get random text messages from unknown numbers with content that you have no idea about, it is safe to assume it is a virus.","title":"Internet issue -- security threats, what are they, how to deal with them"},{"location":"security/#resources","text":"Antivirus software How does Antivirus Different types of virus Top 10 Common Security Threats","title":"resources"},{"location":"software/","text":"software by Gillian Clara image design \u00a9 Gillian Clara Software, what is it? Software is a set of instructions, data or programs that are used to operate a computer and complete specific tasks. Software is the complete opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is the generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a specific device. This can be thought of as a variable part of a computer, while hardware is an invariable part of a computer. Next, there is software infrastructures. Infrastructures are the main components required to operate and manage enterprise IT environments. These components include hardware, software, networking components, an operating system (OS), and data storage. All of these components are used to deliver IT services and solutions. To continue onto software categories, these are groups of software. They allow software to be understood in terms of those components. Typically, there are two major classifications of software, system software and application software. System software aids the user and the hardware to function and interact with each other. In simple words, you could say that the system software is an intermediary or a middle layer between the user and the hardware. Some things that fall under this category are operating system, device drivers, firmware, programming language translators and utility. Furthermore, application software, also known as end-user programs or productivity programs. These are software that helps the user in completing tasks such as doing online research, jotting down some notes, setting an alarm, designing graphics, keeping an account log, ect. They lie right above the system software. Unlike system software, they are used by the end-user and are specific to their functionality or tasks, they do the jobs that they are designed to do. Some things that fall under this category are word processors, database software, multimedia software, education and references software, graphics software and web browsers.

Web development is the process of constructing and maintaining a website. It also consists of all the small details and fine tuning of a website that makes it function and look great. There are two parts that make up the web development field. Those two fields are called the front-end devs and the back-end devs. The \u201cfront-end\u201d refers to the user interface side and the \u201cback-end\u201d is the server side. The \u201cfront-end\u201d is what you see and interact with. Such as the text, dropdown menus and over all, all visual aspects. The \u201cback-end\u201d devs are what runs the website and what keeps it functioning and running. Which consists of all the data, data storage, and programs that make the website up to date and efficient. Storage What is storage? Storage is basically the amount of data that is and can be stored on your website. To store data on the internet you will need a server. Servers are what help us store data on the internet. The capacity of said servers will tell you how much storage you have. However, storage is not an infinite thing. This is because servers are physical objects that take up space and have a certain capacity for running numbers. Bandwidth Bandwidth and storage are often confused for one another. Bandwidth is the connectivity of servers and data. It also relatively refers to the amount of data transferred. To be more specific bandwidth can also be referred to as the measured amount of data being sent back and forth from website to server. A good example of bandwidth is traffic. Imagine there are 3,300 cars that need to go down the same road to get to their destination. A road needs to be built accordingly. Therefore the road should be built so that it can maintain 4,000 cars to be more efficient and avoid the risk of any possible traffic jams. Backups When important documents or important information that is copied and stored apart from its original copy. It is to ensure that the information won't get lost. This is the process of a backup. There are different types of backups. One being a Full backup. A full backup refers to copying everything that is deemed important. And is generally the copy of the first most reliable document. The second type of backup is an incremental backup. This type of backup will save space and time by detecting that all the files in the full backup will remain the same. The third and final type of backup is the Differential backup. The differential backup is almost identical to the incremental file. Except with the differential backup, all the files created since the original full backup will always be copied again. resources web development definition storage bandidth and connectivity difference between storage and bandwidth types of backup mistakes to avoid","title":"storage"},{"location":"storage/#general-intro-to-web-development-storage-bandwidths-and-backups","text":"by Karlie Morey image design by \u00a9 Karlie Morey","title":"General Intro to Web development: Storage, Bandwidths and Backups"},{"location":"storage/#web-development","text":"Understanding Web development.
