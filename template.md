your written content here. each paragraph is just a chunk of text and stuff. markdown lets you use special characters to format your content. for example, you can *add one asterisk to get italic*. **add two asterisks to get bold**. ***add three asterisks to get both italic and bold***. you can use brackets and parenthesis to get [link text](https://mister-chad.com).

## subheading that shows in the table of contents

more content here. you get the idea. use the subheadings to break up content. each heading is indicated by a hashtag symbol. 

one hashtag gives you an H1, which i have reserved for the page title.

two hashtags are for H2 headings that will appear in the table of contents links in the sidebar. you can have as many of these as you need, but please save them for the big sections of your document. 


### smaller subheading that is indented in table of contents

three hashtags are for H3 headings that are a little less important. you can use as many of these as you need. 

more content here. you get the idea. 

the three dashes in the next line create a horizontal rule line across the page when converted to html.
